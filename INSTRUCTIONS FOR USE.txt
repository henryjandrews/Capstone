###### INSTRUCTIONS ######

Technology Used:
	- PHP 7.0.9*, with PDO enabled in php.ini
	- MySQL Server 5.7**
	- Node.JS
	- HTML5
	- Bootstrap
* PHP 5.5.X works as well
** importing the database file on an older version of MySQL will not work

Suggestions:
	- We suggest the use of MAMP Free Version (https://www.mamp.info/en/) to setup and launch the project php server
	- MySQL Server 5.7 and MySQL workbench (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) to edit database schema and launch the database server

Instructions for MAMP to view site:
	- Once downloaded, default save location should be in the C:\ drive.
	- Copy Capstone folder once unzipped and paste it into C:\MAMP\htdocs
	- Once database is setup and Capstone folder is placed in htdocs, run MAMP
	- Hit 'Preferences' 
	- On the 'Ports' tab, select an open port for apache to run the php server
	- On the 'PHP' tab, select your version of PHP
	- On the 'WebServer' tab, select Apache
	- Hit 'ok' and 'Start Servers' (if servers aren't running, you can see the status in the top right)
	- Click on 'Open start page'
	- Once the start page opens, in the navigation bar you can navigate through the file system by changing:
		http://localhost:81/MAMP/
		to: http://localhost:81/capstone/Capstone-master/capstoneWebsite/mainPage.php

Instructions for MySQL:
	- Navigate into the capstone folder and retreive the database file, this should be saved in C:\MAMP\htdocs\Capstone\Capstone-master\capstoneWebsite\db
	- The database file is named 'KeySight'
	- In order for the project to connect to the database, database.php must be configured to run with your system parameters, 
		necessary information is detailed within database.php (C:\MAMP\htdocs\Capstone\Capstone-master\capstoneWebsite\php\)
	- With MySQL Server and Workbench downloaded open workbench and create a new localhost connection following the instructions here (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-mysql-connections-new.html)
	- Open the localhost server connection and once connected click on the 'File' drop down in the top left of the screen.
	- Choose 'Run SQL Script' and choose KeySight.sql
	- Ensure that table and column names kept their case scheme and are consistent with database.php query calls (ran into a few errors when importing/exporting)*
* might involve renaming tables (for example 'answer' -> 'Answer')
